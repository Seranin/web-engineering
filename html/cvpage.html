                        I am Anita Rumen Ugrinska, a first year in ICT at Thomas More.
                        I'm specializing in Application development with the hopes of doing game development in the near future. 
                        Although I am far from knowledgeable, the motivation I have goes hand in hand with my passion for games, so I am certain this will be the first but certainly not last project I work on.
